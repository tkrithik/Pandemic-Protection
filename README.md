## Pandemic Protection's Website:

### www.pandemicprotection.gq

###### In order to have a marketing model to reach customers, we used the Internet and created a website to suit this purpose. By utilising a form of communication the majority of the population could connect to, we are able to inform people from across the globe of new means to protect themselves through the development of a website. This not only allows us to connect to more people, it also allows us to protect more people. Through our marketing website, we were able to easily convey our message. While testing our product, we were not able to visually show users the functions and features of our design. However, through our online platform, users could interact and learn more about various aspects and upcoming updates of our design, allowing them to give feedback and get a feel for our design. This website was coded using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The completed code can be found here.
